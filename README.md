# Location Recommendation for Bank Branch using Distributed Clustering

A recommendation system which uses distributed clustering to recommend possible locations to the user, based on available data.
In the current scenario, clustering has importance in manipulating large amounts of data.
Conventionally, all the data needs to be brought to a centralized location where it is evaluated and recommendations are made. 
This approach has large communication overhead, central storage requirements and requires large computation time. 
Our method involves clustering the datasets locally and sending local representatives to a central site where the representatives are evaluated and recommendations are made to the user. 
Our Distributed Database Clustering approach significantly reduces transmission cost with improved quality in clustering.
